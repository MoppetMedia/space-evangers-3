<p>More about Ella: Telekinesis is her favourite superpower, for practical reasons and to feel like a wizard! Her favourite onomatopoeia are the more unique and made up ones, like KRRRRK, GAZORG, PLIPLPLIP, SCHOOOP, and WEEWOO. While working on Space Evangers, she listens to orchestral and epic instrumental (Hans Zimmer). She prays and hopes the stories of Space Evangers brings you  a smile, a controversial thought, many theological musings, and endless imagination!</p>



<h2>Muhammad Bukhari: Lead Scriptwriter</h2>
<img src="./Muhammad Artwork.jpg" alt="Muhammad Bukhari Artwork" width="300" height="400" align="left">
<p>Mohammed is the Lead Scriptwriter. He also works out the administrative and networking side of things. Originally from Pakistan, he is currently studying for a PhD in theology at Protestant Theological University in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Ever since he was little, he has wanted to be a writer. He is excited to combine his passion for history and theology with science fiction and fantasy!</p>

<p>Muhammad feels that although ideas seemingly pop in out of nowhere, when you follow the thread back, you can see how things fall into place. An avid reader of missionary biographies, filled as they are with adventure and daring, at one point, he had been watching some retro cartoons like Flash Gordon whilst also contemplating about the exciting time for space exploration we live in with landing rockets now and planned human trips to Mars. Somewhere in his mind, all these ingredients came together and Space Evangers was born.</p>

<p>More about Muhammad: his favourite superpower is flight, 'cause it's awesome! He took some flying lessons as a kid and it just stayed. His favourite onomatopoeia is POW!!! While working on Space Evangers, he listens to a mix of soundtracks, mostly depending on the story he's working on at the moment. But generally he loves listening to the soundtracks and music of retro cartoons like Biker Mice from Mars, Swat Kats, Galaxy Rangers, etc. He prays and hopes Space Evangers will inspire a new generation of missionaries for Jesus Christ.</p>
